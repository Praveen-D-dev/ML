# 🧠 Machine Learning Study Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning journey! This repository contains basic yet fundamental ML projects and code examples I’ve worked on while learning the core concepts. These projects are beginner-friendly and focus on understanding the **essence of ML algorithms** with hands-on practice.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Here's what you'll find inside:

- 📊 **Linear Regression**
  - Basic linear model to predict continuous values.
  - Dataset used: Simple dummy data / custom CSV.

- 🔐 **Logistic Regression**
  - Classification algorithm to predict binary outcomes.
  - Example: Predicting if a student passes or fails.

- 🤝 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - Supervised classification algorithm using proximity.
  - Example: Classifying points based on nearest neighbors.

- 📍 **K-Means Clustering**
  - Unsupervised learning to find natural clusters.
  - Visualizing clusters using matplotlib and seaborn.

- 📈 **Seaborn Library Examples**
  - Data visualization examples using Seaborn.
  - Different types of plots like heatmap, pairplot, etc.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the notebooks:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praveen-D-dev/ML.git
